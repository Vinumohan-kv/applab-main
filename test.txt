General info on Drupal

- What it is:
  Drupal is an open-source content management framework (CMS) written in PHP. It provides a flexible platform for building websites, web applications, and complex content-driven systems.

- Core concepts:
  - Content types & nodes: structured content defined by fields.
  - Entities & fields: extensible data model used for users, taxonomy terms, files, etc.
  - Taxonomy: tagging and classification system.
  - Blocks & regions: layout pieces placed in theme regions.
  - Views: powerful query and display builder for lists, tables, pages, REST outputs.
  - Configuration management: declarative config export/import (config sync).
  - Theming: Twig templating for markup and templates.
  - Access control: roles and permissions framework.

- Architecture & ecosystem:
  - Modular: functionality added via contributed modules or custom modules.
  - Themes control presentation; base themes and sub-themes common.
  - Composer-first project structure (Drupal 8+).
  - Drush and Drupal Console for CLI tasks and automation.
  - Strong caching layers (render cache, page cache, dynamic page cache) and performance tools.

- Use cases:
  - Content-rich sites, intranets, community sites, government and enterprise platforms, headless CMS via JSON:API.

- Security & best practices:
  - Keep core and modules up to date.
  - Use HTTPS, proper file permissions, and secure hosting.
  - Use configuration management and automated deployments.
  - Audit contributed modules for maintenance and security history.

- Getting started:
  - Recommended workflow: Composer to create projects, use Drush for CLI tasks, export/import config for environments.
  - Official resources: documentation and module listings on drupal.org; API docs on api.drupal.org.

- When to choose Drupal:
  - Choose Drupal if you need a highly configurable content model, complex permissions, strong multilingual support, or enterprise-level extensibility.
